# Networked-Control-of-a-MIMO-System
**Centralized/Decentralized/Distributed control comparison of a 5th order, MIMO, linear, time-invariant system**.

Project held at the Politecnico di Milano in the exam "Networked Control" held by Prof. Farina.

The objective of the project is to design and compare different control schemes (centralized, decentralized, and distributed) for the system under consideration using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Project done entirely in simulation on Matlab using Control Toolbox and Yalmip, assuming ideal communication between the controllers.
