# Networked-Control-of-a-MIMO-System
**Centralized/Decentralized/Distributed control comparison of a 5th order, MIMO, linear, time-invariant system**.

The objective of the project is to design and compare different control schemes (centralized, decentralized, and distributed) for the system under consideration using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Project done entirely in simulation on Matlab using Control Toolbox and Yalmip.
